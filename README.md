The odelia package for R is an ODE solver in C++ header files, using RK4-5. There's potenital to link to R via Rcpp. Code was first developed by  Rich FitzJohn as part of the [plant package](https://github.com/traitecoevo/plant/). I'm spinning that code out into a package, as I want to use it elsewhere.
